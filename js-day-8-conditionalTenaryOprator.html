    <qoutes><b>The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands:<br> a condition followed by a question mark (?),<br> then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:),<br> and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.<br> This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.</b></qoutes>
