    <h1>OBJECT ORIENTD PROGRAMING</h1>
    <qoute>A style of Object-oriented programming (OOP) in which inheritance occurs via defining classes of objects, instead of inheritance occurring via the objects alone. The most popular model of OOP is class-based. But as I mentioned, JavaScript isn't a classed-based langauge â€“ it's is a prototype-based langauge</qoute>

    <ul style="font-style: italic;">
       <li>code more modular and reusable</li>
       <li>well organised code</li>
       <li>Easier to debug</li>
       <li>Best for medium to large website projects</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>class</h2>
    <qoute1>In object-oriented programming, a class is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object. Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables. The class is one of the defining ideas of object-oriented programming<br><br>.</qoute1>
